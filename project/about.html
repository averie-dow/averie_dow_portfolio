    <h2 class="content-subheader academics ">Academics!</h1>
    <p class="content-blurb academics">As of October 1st, 2025, I am third-year senior at CU Boulder. I am working
      hard on finishing my Information Science
      degree and completing my minor in Creative Technology & 
      Design Engineering as well as my new 
      certificate in User Experience design! 
      My favorite class I am taking right now is called "Text" with 
      Dr. Danny Rankin! It is a critical view at how fonts and textual Information
      can be used to persuade users and convey different tones. I am getting an in-depth look
      at how to use Adobe Illustrator, and I am LOVING learning more about it! My most recent design 
      was a specimen poster for the font, Proxima Nova.

    <p class="content-blurb">
      Career-wise, I celebrated my one year anniversary
      as an Undergraduate User Experience Designer for 
      the UX Team at CU Boulder's Office of Information Technology! I am very excited
    to continue working with them professionally during my last year at CU and keep
    making helpful and accessible UX changes on and off campus!</p>

      <h3 class="content-subsubheader">CU Boulder Safe</h3>
      <p class="content-blurb">My most recently completed project was for CU Boulder Safe, which is 
      a CU community safety application for students, faculty, and staff. 
      We worked closely with the CU Boulder Police Department to conduct 
      initial interviews and further user research on the usability
      of the application as it initially came from its parent company, AppArmor.
    While I was involved in the User Research, I was primarily focused on the design. 
  I used data collected from usability tests to find the most easily recognized iconography
for each of the available safety functions on CU Boulder Safe. </p></section>

      <h3 class="content-subsubheader">World of Vikings</h4>
      <p class="content-blurb">
        I am fresh off of my 2025 Summer Abroad in Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden with DIS Abroad! While I was abroad 
        I took three courses to fulfill some elective credits, including Norse Mythology, World of Vikings, 
        and Women in the Viking Age. No, I was not REQUIRED to take only viking-related courses. It was my pleasure. One of the most interesting
        parts I learned about Scandinavian culture in the Viking Age was that women actually had a fairly
        autonomous role in society and were able to divorce, own property, and, in some cases (and with much debate
        in the community) go on viking. Additionally, the Scandinavian raiders were not "Vikings" they were farmers,
        traders, etc. who went "on viking." "To go on viking" actually refers to anyone who travels a distance to 
        retrieve goods or learn something. So technically while I was abroad, I was on viking.
